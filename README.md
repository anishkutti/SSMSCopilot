With Copilot embedded directly into SSMS, SQL developers can now leverage natural language prompts to generate T-SQL queries, optimize performance, and troubleshoot issuesâ€”all within their familiar development environment. 

This integration brings AI-assisted coding, context-aware suggestions, and real-time insights into query plans and schema design, streamlining complex tasks and accelerating development cycles. 

Whether you're writing stored procedures, analyzing execution plans, or exploring data, Copilot in SSMS 21 transforms how developers interact with SQL Server.
